## Project Goal
I personally enjoy reading novels and manga comics very much. I believe many people, like me, need personalized recommendations to find content they are interested in. Traditional recommendation systems usually rely on users' historical data and ratings, but these methods may not meet the needs of those who want to explore more detailed/specific subjects or try some new subjects.

This project aims to use the latest LLaMA3 Instruct model, combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, to build a novel/manga recommender. Users can input the novel or manga genres or tags they are interested in, and the system will query the relevant database and generate a personalized recommendation list.

## Timeline(Week)
1. Investigate the LLaMA3 instruct model and the usage of LLamafile.

2. Collect and preprocess relevant data for novels and manga.

3. Configure and test the LLaMA3 instruct model with LLamafile.

4. Develop and test the backend API with RAG mechanism.

5. Continue backend development and testing.

6. Design and implement the frontend interface.

7. Optimize the frontend based on user feedback.

8. Integrate the frontend and backend systems.

9. Deploy the services to a local server and conduct initial testing.

10. Perform comprehensive testing and optimize the system.

11. Document the project and summarize the outcomes.

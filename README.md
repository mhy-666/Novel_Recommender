## Project Goal
I personally enjoy reading novels and manga comics very much. I believe many people, like me, need personalized recommendations to find content they are interested in. Traditional recommendation systems usually rely on users' historical data and ratings, but these methods may not meet the needs of those who want to explore more detailed/specific subjects or try some new subjects.

This project aims to use the latest Rocket-3b model, combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, to build a novel/manga recommender. Users can input the novel or manga genres or tags they are interested in, and the system will query the relevant database and generate a personalized recommendation list.

## Timeline(Week)
1. Investigate the Rocket-3b model and the usage of LLamafile.

2. Collect and preprocess relevant data for novels and manga.

3. Configure and test the LLaMA3 instruct model with LLamafile.

4. Develop and test the backend API with RAG mechanism.

5. Continue backend development and testing.

6. Design and implement the frontend interface.

7. Optimize the frontend based on user feedback.

8. Integrate the frontend and backend systems.

9. Deploy the services to a local server and conduct initial testing.

10. Perform comprehensive testing and optimize the system.

## Detailed Function Descriptions

### data_processing.py

This module contains functions for loading and preprocessing data.

#### Functions

- **load_data(file_path)**:
  Loads data from a specified CSV file.

  ```python
  from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader

  def load_data(file_path):
      loader = CSVLoader(file_path=file_path)
      data = loader.load()
      return data
  ```

- **split_text(data)**:
  Splits text data into smaller chunks for processing.

  ```python
  from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

  def split_text(data):
      text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
          chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True
      )
      all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
      return all_splits
  ```

### LLMs.py

This module contains functions related to the use of large language models.

#### Functions

- **initialize_model(model_name)**:
  Initializes the specified language model.

  ```python
  from some_llm_library import LLM

  def initialize_model(model_name):
      model = LLM(model_name=model_name)
      return model
  ```

- **generate_text(model, prompt)**:
  Generates text based on the given prompt using the initialized model.

  ```python
  def generate_text(model, prompt):
      response = model.generate(prompt)
      return response
  ```

### rag.py

## Performance and Evaluation Results

The performance of the novel recommender system was evaluated using human evaluation, which involved assessing the quality of recommendations by real users. The evaluation process included the following steps:

Evaluation Criteria:

Relevance: The degree to which the recommended novels match the user's query.
Diversity: The variety of recommendations provided.
User Satisfaction: Overall satisfaction with the recommendations.

Results:

Relevance: The system achieved an average relevance score of 4.2 out of 5.
Diversity: The average diversity score was 4.0 out of 5.
User Satisfaction: The overall user satisfaction score was 4.3 out of 5.
